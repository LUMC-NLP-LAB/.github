Hi there

The LUMC-NLP-LAB is a project group in the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) focussing on the deployment of Large Language Models in time consuming administrative tasks in the field of cardiology, oncology and anaesthesiology.

This page will be used to share the scripts, created by members or the LUMC-NLP-LAB, in which LLMs are used to perform administrative tasks. Each project will have it's own repository, feel free to explore. 

**Do note that most members of the LUMC-NLP-LAB primarily have a biomedical background, and have had no professional computer science training!**
